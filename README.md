# GroupedUp

This is the repository for group 47 in tutorial 0201. 
The purpose of our application is too create an app for UofT students to find groups! There are 8 features: login/logout, create group, edit your user or group profile, Apply/Leave/Cancel/Approve group application, and find groups through our Matching Algorithm.

You can find our **workflow documents** under the Projects tab: where we have our pull request history and backlog.
